# Why understanding computers is beneficial to everyone. 
Firstly, let me explain what I mean by *understanding computers*. 
I am a software engineer who looks at log files like this. 
 `New request for: Something Secret with parameters {something here}`  
 and write code like  
`if word = "Hello World" 
  print "Hello there"  
else  
   print "No Hello?"`  
but this is on the other end of what I want to talk about. I want to get you to understand that checking why your laptop/phone/tablet is not connected to the internet is a very simple process at the highest level. I want to get you to understand that looking at who sent the email is as important for your personal data than not clicking on a link.  
I **WILL NOT** be going in to how to write your own cryptocurrency or anything technical, I **WILL BE** going into some basic non-technical things that computers do and how you can use them to fix/solve basic, everyday problems.

## TODO
- It is in human nature to be angry/scared/frustrated when in the unknown  
- Basic troubleshooting is key to owning electronic devices
- Understanding code is not essential
